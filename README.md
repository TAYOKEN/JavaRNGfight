## Important Note : Incomplete State

### Point of the game

You start a fight with a weak enemy, but your are weak too,
you have to pick an item to start either way you're doing nothing you have the choice between Sword, Shield, Magic and Heal,
you can choose one per turn, when you defeat the enemy, you get XP and fight a stronger enemy.
Of course more XP = more Level, which gives you more HP, inventory space and effiency.

### What I'm working on right now

-Create ennemies

-Create a GUI (might go on a game engine)

-Generate an actual fight experience

-XP and Lvl 

### Might be useful in case of a new college project
